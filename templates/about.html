    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
    Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
    Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
    Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
    action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
    leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
            Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the
            dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated
            when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies
            beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree
            branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even
            in death.

            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews
            of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Oin's uncle was Fundin,
            the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling.

            Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a
            member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other dwarves on the
            quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug.

            In TA 2941, the three became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling with him in
            search of Smaug's treasure at the Lonely Mountain.

            Nori, as was his brother Dori, was a capable flutist, and both seem to have carried their flutes with them.
            Both shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in

            Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not of Durin's Folk. Most of his familial
            relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were driven out
            of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the Dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf
            warrior worked as a toy maker.

        <h3>Bofur</h3>
        <p>
            Bofur's heritage is unclear, but he was not of Durin's Folk. He and his family hailed from the Blue
            Mountains. As such, they felt less strongly about the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon
            Smaug, more interested in the adventure than a home they'd never seen.

        <h3>Bombur</h3>
        <p>
            Bombur's parentage is unknown. He is the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's
            line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Moria. His birth date is unknown, though it fell
            somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some
            fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and
            Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey,
            Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

            Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar (with the possible exception of
